React component library for displaying digital twin information.

Library was created following the tutorial at https://dev.to/alexeagleson/how-to-create-and-publish-a-react-component-library-2oe

Instructions on developing new components for twinpage:

First, install packages with "npm install". Then add a folder in the folder "src/components". Add your component and file "index.ts" in the folder you just created. Then export your component in both of the "index.ts" files. The other one is located in "src". 

To test your component locally make a "story" under the folder "src/stories" and then run "npm run storybook". For making stories, you can follow the existing stories and look more information in https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories
